## Methods

### NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel

`func NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel(includeSteps bool, includeLinks bool, includeLabels bool, ) *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel`

NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel instantiates a new SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModelWithDefaults

`func NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModelWithDefaults() *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel`

NewSearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModelWithDefaults instantiates a new SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetIncludeSteps

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeSteps() bool`

GetIncludeSteps returns the IncludeSteps field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetIncludeStepsOk

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeStepsOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetIncludeStepsOk returns a tuple with the IncludeSteps field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetIncludeSteps

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) SetIncludeSteps(v bool)`

SetIncludeSteps sets IncludeSteps field to given value.


### GetIncludeLinks

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeLinks() bool`

GetIncludeLinks returns the IncludeLinks field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetIncludeLinksOk

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeLinksOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetIncludeLinksOk returns a tuple with the IncludeLinks field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetIncludeLinks

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) SetIncludeLinks(v bool)`

SetIncludeLinks sets IncludeLinks field to given value.


### GetIncludeLabels

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeLabels() bool`

GetIncludeLabels returns the IncludeLabels field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetIncludeLabelsOk

`func (o *SearchAutoTestsQueryIncludesModel) GetIncludeLabelsOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetIncludeLabelsOk returns a tuple with the IncludeLabels field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.
